'Kingsman: The Golden Circle' has everything fans of the first film
could have possibly wanted and more. Action, humour and special effects
are all in abundance and visually it's very impressive. The plot is
decent, especially for a sequel, but it never quite reaches the same
level as the first film. The British/American theme works well though
and there are some very funny cultural jokes and references.As someone who loved the first 'Kingsman', I'm pleased that the sequel
didn't disappoint. It remains true to everything that made the first
film such a success, including taking some big risks and thinking out
of the box. The end result is an imperfect and at times messy film, but
a rewarding and highly entertaining one nonetheless. 'The Golden
Circle' is much better than expected but just not quite on the same
level as the first film.

Why is it that so many fun, inspired originals are followed by such
lame, poorly written (and juvenile) sequels? The first one was a hugely entertaining spy flick with some comedy in
it to be sure, but this one puts the accent on the comedy, and is
impossible to take seriously whatsoever. This would not have really
been an issue if it was genuinely funny; but instead of wit and clever
wordplay, we are 'treated' to an abundance of uninspired, vulgar and
childish humour. Elton John repeatedly dropping the F-Bomb (Please,
don't go on), a attractive woman asking someone to urinate on her (I
can't stop laughing), or an old man stating that he has just soiled
himself (Stop, my sides are hurting). Actually, my head hurt after
sitting through 141 minutes of this. (Well over half an hour too long).
I recommend waiting for Netflix.

Like many others I'm sure, I went into Kingsman 2 apprehensively.As a
massive fan of the first I was concerned that like many other sequels,
it would disappoint.I left entertained and pleasantly surprised HOWEVER
it is not without its flaws .The story briefly- Eggsy (a brilliant again Taron Egerton)and Merlin
have to team up with the American Kingsman 'The Statesmen' to get to
the bottom of a virus being spread by Poppy, our films 'bad guy' played
by a wonderfully evil Julianne Moore. There are some twists and turns
along the way (the trailers already spoil the surprise return of Harry
Hart but I will not give details of how this happens)some of which you
wont expect (others are pretty obvious but more on that in a minute!)What I liked- For me it was great to revisit loved characters from the
first and there are some interesting new characters. It is a fun film
that is very reflective of the fact it is comic book material.It
entertains with some great OTT action sequences and some real laugh out
loud moments.The acting is strong and this helps to carry the story
which somewhat engages. What will surprise many (as it did me) is the
emotion to the film. It delivers some real emotionally charged moments
and one scene delivers a particularly powerful gut punch.Where it does fall down-as already mentioned the story isn't the
strongest and at points falls apart from too many players and some
obvious plot twists.This creates a longer run time than the film can
carry so it does lag at points. A good 20 minutes shorter would have
made for a higher rating from myself. The action scenes whilst great
also are very apparently CGI heavy which might bother some. It also
does that cheeky thing of selling on some certain big stars which
whilst this wasn't a particular draw for me, it might disappoint some
to find they are actually only in the film for a few short scenes
(those who see it will get exactly who I am talking about!!) To me it
is comparable to Guardians of the Galaxy 2- some great moments that
make you glad you decided to return, but it doesn't quite deliver on
the story. That being said I would still recommend Kingsman 2 and would
revisit this film again in the future as well as hope for a further
installment.



It's essentially all a big joke played on those who took umbrage at the
few select sexualised moments from the final act of the first film, a
joke whereby everything is consistently ramped up to eleven regardless
of its negative impact on the story in a standoffish move meant to
further separate the apparent 'critics' from the so-called 'fans', a
move that only successfully provides both categories with a much worse
experience, because while I and many other 'fans' didn't mind (or at
least excused) the passive, clearly satirical crude jests and
occasional absurdity of the original picture, we certainly didn't want
a follow-up based entirely around what would obviously be considered
the weakest aspects of the piece - elements which were only mitigated
by the joyous fun found in the brilliance of the other parts such as
the subtle yet witty satire and the very well developed characters,
pieces of the puzzle now missing; though it is at times passively
entertaining, what we're left with is a fairly by-the-numbers
'save-the-world' plot and a string of odd action set- pieces seemingly
incompetently put together, with abhorrent use of rampant speed-
ramping making it literally look like someone hit the fast-forward
button and haphazardly stitched-together short takes that are supposed
to make some sequences look like one fluid shot but instead make them
look like cheap cartoons - in his quest to ignore the naysayers, Vaughn
disappointingly squanders all of the good-will he had built with his
predecessor and bizarrely wipes the slate clean relatively early on,
wasting time setting up a less interesting new set of characters
instead of working with the better characters already expertly
established at the end of the prior title, while also reintroducing a
previously dead character (seen in the trailers), after making him an
amnesiac no less, in a move that should be reserved only for a waning
franchise at least five films in that's struggling to maintain it's
relevancy, not for what was once perhaps the most promising new
property in Hollywood. 6/10

1(awful).... Actually that is a KIND rating, but there's no option for
a negative rating so I went as low as I could. Simply stated, I went to
this film on the basis of its prequel which while not great, was
entertaining. This film is so STUPID and poorly written that I'm
frankly astonished that any of the "talent" hired to play the roles,
agreed to do it at all lest their resumes be thoroughly sullied. I've
walked out of 3 or 4 movies in my life. Tonight I added another. Don't
waste your time unless you enjoy AWFUL films and you're a cinematic
masochist. My time would have been better spent sorting socks.

Cartoonish-type plot, totally silly. But we laughed throughout and were
entertained. Two words...ELTON JOHN! Hysterical to this 56 year old
lady and her 64 year old husband. Understandably millennials won't
share the same heartfelt enjoyment in seeing Sir Elton John in this
role. But he was great & he made us Laugh! We only wished he would've
belted out one of his hits from the piano loft in the last scene. (or
even during the end credits) Julianne Moore was perfectly wonderful as
the villain, she never disappoints. In fact, most all the cast did a
good job keeping the story moving along and with much comic relief!
Halle Berry was the only disappointment as Ginger. I didn't see any
worth in her character or how she played it. I call this type of film
Mindless Fun. In this regard, I think you will enjoy it.

My friends and I wanted to see a fun movie for a change. We needed
something to distract us and laugh in part to cheer me up. I found what
I needed in the story and mainly in the character Eggsy, he made me
smile. Made me confident that men can treat ladies well. The actor
Taron is super cute too, don't usually go for guys like him ;)
Channning was amazing too, he should have danced more lol Plus the
effects and fight/action choreography were tight and unexpected. This
exciting movie successfully changed my grim mood!



After reading some critical reviews on IMDb I should have trusted my
gut feeling. There are a few (three, possibly four) funny moments in
this movie, but overall I found watching this movie a boring, sometimes
even frustrating experience. The performance of Elton John is pathetic.
Maybe he needed the money? Conclusion: stay away and spend your money
elsewhere.



Although it seems like I beat the crap out of this film, I honestly
enjoyed it. Sure it had its issues and mistakes, but if you go into it
knowing that it might not be a good as the first film, then you'll end
up having a great time. Yes the antagonist is poor, the opening
exposition is rushed, and a lot of characters are just thrown into the
background, but even with that Kingsman: The Golden Circle is still a
pretty good time to be had. Contrary to popular belief, I really enjoy
Vaughn's unique style of directing, and although some might find it
immersion breaking, I think it's a great way to help differentiate the
Kingsman series from other films within the genre. Egerton was great
again as Eggsy, and both Strong and (surprisingly) Berry provided some
great performances and character depth. Although critics might disagree
with me on this one, I decided to give Kingsman: The Golden Circle a
"Good" on theVade Review Bar or a 7 out of 10. But with all that being
said, The Golden Circle is still a sequel shadowed by its beloved
predecessor. It's not a film to break the sequel curse, but it does do
a pretty damn good job at trying to.Read more at theVade.

Okay...so Kingsman: The golden circle goes wild wild west.Again, kingsman doesn't fail to amuse the audience.Is it as good as the first one? well it is as creative and fun! but
sequels rarely surpass the original.Think of the movie as if will smith's wild wild west and I-robot had a
baby.Nevertheless, charming storyline and cast.


*** This review may contain spoilers ***


This is the action spy adventure sequel to 'The Secret Service'.There are plenty of over the top action sequences, but the plot is
poorly conceived. More time on developing the plot would have been well
invested. The Kingsman headquarters is targeted and destroyed and most
of the Kingsman members are simultaneously targeted and killed off,
except Eggsy (Taron Egerton) and Merlin (Mark Strong). This film then introduces the USA counterparts 'The Statesmen'. The
disaster takes them to the USA where they need to team up to defeat the
villain. The villain (Julianne Moore), saturates every popular drug
with a slowly acting deadly virus. Our hero's mission is to retrieve a
sample of the antidote. The best parts are the cameos from Elton John, in flamboyant costumes.
These were truly brilliant. Having enjoyed the first Kingsman, I
wanting to like this, but this is not as fresh as the launch film,
sequels are rarely as good. I ended up feeling disappointed. Essentially this is perfect for a 12 year old (or younger) audience.



Kingsman: The Golden Circle is a fun and action packed sequel
delivering on the success of the first film. The film combines British
style with American swagger and certainly doesn't pull any punches both
updating the spy genre and being a parody of it.The film begins with a brilliant and heart pounding action sequence
which immediately sets the tone of the film. The action sequences are
very consistent throughout the duration of the movie and with an
English action director like Matthew Vaughn I would expect nothing
less. Kingsman 2 is very enjoyable and is an excellent film if you just want
to sit back and watch an amusing film that doesn't take itself too
seriously. However, I would say that the film has been highly
Americanised for a mass market. This is a positive and a negative. It
is a positive as we get a lot of excellent American/Englishman banter.
However, that being, said an aspect of the original film's charm is
lost. The acting is in general very good with Taron Egerton returning as
Eggsy, once again delivering an assured and confident performance. Old
favourites also return to the cast along with a few new members each
giving first-rate performances. Julianne Moore stars as a megalomaniac
villain called Poppy. The character is a caricature of an archetypal
villain but because of the film's light and humorous tone this doesn't
matter too much as the movie is just so much fun. Overall, the film is a really entertaining and although it isn't quite
as good as the original, it is still definitely a worthy sequel.
Kingsman: The Golden Circle incorporates brilliant British humour which
is packaged up for American audiences. I would give the film 7 out of
10.



If you enjoyed the first Kingsman movie, likely you will this one as
well. If like myself you found it to be a spy film beset by a
nauseating combination of cameo, bad sex jokes and hyperbolic,
cartoonish plot, The Golden Circle is not going to change your mind.Poppy (Julianne Moore) has transformed undiscovered ruins in Cambodia
into a land of kitsch 50s Americana, from where she controls the
world's recreational drug supply. She has spiked said drug supply so as
to hold the world leader's to ransom, either legalizing all drugs or
letting millions of their citizens die. All of the Kingsman secret
agents have been wiped out aside from the main cast of the first film,
meaning they have to team up with their American cousins to eliminate
this threat.If a world under threat from some all encompassing power that causes
people to act erratically sounds familiar, that's because the central
plot of The Golden Circle is identical to the first film. This time as
well as underwriting the British working class, there is also ample
opportunity to make broad stereotypes of Kentucky natives too.The use of music in film can be a joy, Tarantino going so far as to say
it's 'just about as cinematic a thing as you can do. You are really
doing what movies do better than any other art form; it really works in
this visceral, emotional, cinematic way that's just really special'.
Writer-director Matthew Vaughn prostitutes this great cinematic virtue,
over- using from the first time Eggsy kicks the radio mid-fight to
Merlin (Mark Strong) singing John Denver. It's all so painfully obvious
and dull, the kid who attempts to be funny by talking over everyone all
the time.If the music is cloyingly over-done it's only one part of the
interminable fight sequences. With heroes surviving headshots all this
running around is little more than a slideshow for different places in
the world. As the film reaches its climax anyone could tell you who
lives and who dies and that Elton John's excruciating cameo will play
some strained part. All there is to do is sit back and watch the green
screen, wondering where it all went wrong and why does no-one want to
make a spy film with characters and coherence.There's also a reason no film with a phonebook of stars can be
considered a classic after Grand Hotel. With only a few minutes to
introduce themselves and engage in some sort of subplot, it all feels
like a waste. In The Golden Circle it's hard to think who is more
underwhelming, Academy Award Winner Halle Berry or Channing Tatum, who
is removed from proceedings just as he is introduced. At least Pedro
Pascal fully inhabits his juvenile surrounds, and Mark Strong is an
engaging screen presence with a little smidgen of character to work
off.A low-point of the first Kingsmen was Samuel L. Jackson's screechy turn
as the big bad. Julianne Moore as sociopath-come-housewife may be as
obvious an irony as calling a drug lord Poppy, but she certainly
doesn't grate (or mince) in the same way as her predecessor. The
strange joy taken in churchgoers being massacred or heads exploding
like fireworks found in the original is also passed over.The script's nonsensical nature, co-written with Jane Goldman, varies
from the minute (Eggsy can't drink with his friends because he's going
to his girlfriend's parents the next night) to the terminal (the
antidote to the spiked drugs is destroyed and rediscovered over and
over). As for any wider message in The Golden Circle, the Machiavellian
intelligence of the President prevents any allegorical comparisons, and
the anti-drug message is about as convincing as Reefer Madness.A final gripe comes with the trailer, giving away plot points that
don't turn up until an hour into the film. What's the point of making
Colin Firth's return a surprise if he's featured so prominently in the
marketing?Onwards to the third film, which I suspect will be essentially the same
film again.christophermarchant.wordpress.com @BrianInvincible



The buzz appears split on this film. It shouldn't be. It's really fun.
A bit violent, but fun! It's well written with humor coming from jokes
in the first film mirroring in this. Anyone who saw the first will
enjoy it that much more, but the film stands alone as well. Just a
humors action adventure film.



This movie reminded me of the old bond movies. Cheesy villains and
gadgets, women with theatrical make up, wall-to-wall yellow teeth and
loud climatic music in wildly inappropriate situations. But I
thoroughly enjoyed its funny moments. Especially when they pointed out
the differences between Americans and the British. It had the best
fight sequences I have ever seen. I'm a big fan of cleverly
choreographed smooth fight sequences with impossibly fluid moves. But
the highlight of the movie was clearly Elton John in his multicolored
chicken costume. He was just hilarious.

This film tells the story of a group of private secret agents, who have
to find out and destroy a plot to kill millions of people through
poisoned illegal drugs."Kingsman: The Golden Circle" is really everything. It is bloody and
violent, but funnily enough these events actually induce laughs. The
wonderful gadgets they have are reminiscent of James Bond, but in this
film it's just more stylish, an a hint of outrageousness that makes it
hilarious and adrenaline pumping at the same time. The lead characters
are charismatic and very handsome. They look super smart in their
suits. The fights are really cool, very choreographed to the point of
getting me amazed by what I see in the screen. It's got many big names
too, and even Elton John who provides much comic relief. In short, I
enjoyed every second of this film. It's a blockbuster that has
everything to please the crowd.



The first Kingsman was very good and the second part didn't disappoint
either. The action and effects were comparable with the first movie but
think the story of the second movie was not that good. The movie had a
nice pace of action from start to end and the acting was very good.In the first movie Samual L. Jackson was outstanding as the bad guy but
think this movie lacked someone like that.



I went to watch this movie merely from trailer and thought would be a
nice one. After watching it, I kind of don't know which genre this
movie should be categorized in. The set feels like that of a cowboy
movie, but there is Instagram, Twitter and drones carrying objects.
When a villain can have lots of secret headquarters ready to dispatch
cure, and since era of drones, it is modern day world and I don't see
need for villain to hide in a secret jungle. There are sophisticated
robots, but nothing sophisticated to monitor her compound - not even a
CCTV camera facing outside the walls!!?? Some movies do not make sense
but they hold you in grip until the very end, this movie doesn't make
sense too and in doing so you are bored and aware of the real life
waiting outside.



Kingsman: The Golden Circleby imputing every mark of its first installment, matthew vaughn doesn't
have much in the script other than a big cast. the movie takes too much
time to set its plot that all the forced characters and sequences seems
not only repetitive but also boring. slogging for 161 minutes, kingsman
only offers you a two page script.

I loved the first one as it was fun and fresh and had the right touch
of humour. However, this followup film feels really contrived and all
of the attempts to contextualise the film to the first with characters,
fight scenes and plot were just constant let-downs. The villains were
less quirky and threatening, and the unraveling plot was rather
preposterous. Even the funniest concept of a kidnapping of a superstar
couldn't save the film, although it had its moments of hilarity.More to the point, the detail of the film was annoying, like everything
seemed to fit together like someone had written it, which of course
they have, but it's just all a little too contrived to enjoy. I never
felt lost in this film at all.

I must admit I kinda waited for this movie because I liked the approach
in the first movie and I thought they will stick to their flow and come
up with something newer and greater but their sequel failed to deliver.
The movie was just a chaotic. In the beginning they flushed bunch of characters with useless bombs
and left in the characters who, they thought, will entertain audience
the most. Did they? Not really. Jokes were mostly worn-out and
characters lacked of depth and stayed very one-dimensional. I can't
even name one character who stood out because they developed NONE. The
movie was also lacking of pressure and bad guys having power over
everything making good guys having really hard time.What were those action scenes? There were no impressive and new moves
which i was kinda waiting for and even their technology seemed very "i
have seen this somewhere". Also, cinematography had some issues- I kinda noticed that the image
was more shaky and blurry that it should have been. For this budget I
expect better quality.Honesty, I have no idea where my 3 stars come from. It just feels wrong
to give it lower rating as I see the average is kind of high.



As a huge, huge fan of the first movie, its pains me to say, this film
is a complete and utter mess. Its just all wrong. Its hard to believe
this movie was made by the same people. Right from the outset its clear
the story is really bad, its incoherent, childish and nonsensical. I
thought to myself, 'Ok its a bad start, it will pick up, keep the
faith!'. But it doesn't! It just bumbles along from the wildly
unbelievable bad guy/lady (Julianne Moore), to the ridiculous premise
of the movie, awful plot lines and script. It felt like the cast didn't
even believe in the movie. Especially Colin Firth, he had a look on his
face through the whole film like he new it was a flop. The plot line
around his character was really awful. Like something a 5 year old
child would dream up.The overall vibe of the movie is really hammy. They have gone complete
slapstick which is a real shame. There are a couple of moments of
humour and wit, but by god this is not a funny movie. It really isn't!
All the attempts at humour fall way short. It all feels forced and
desperate. The writers clearly ran out of ideas in a big way. This
movie reminded me of Zoolander 2, a shambles that I wanted to walk out
on.I knew the movie was 2hrs 20mins long. At a point in the movie it felt
like the plot was wrapping up and it would all be over soon. I looked
at my watch and realised we were only 1hr 20mins in. I thought to
myself 'my word there is one whole hour left!'. I felt sad and like the
next hour was going to be real hard work, which is a real shame. I
leaned into my girlfriend and told her 'There is one more hour of this
movie left!'. I wish I had taken a photo of her expression, it would
speak a 1000 words. Needles to say it was a look of shock and
deflation. She said to me 'Oh god really?'. Unfortunately the movie was
so bad we were both crestfallen knowing we had another whole hour to
go.The first movie was very funny, stylish, silly, witty and slick. The
2nd movie is none of those things. It feels like a very bad slapstick
movie based on the James Bond premise. Its hard to believe they got it
so wrong.This movie has a current rating on here of 7.3 stars. I have no idea on
earth how it is getting that score. I can only assume the vast majority
of people leaving reviews are 13 year old boys.



Nothing but action from start to finish. So much action that it became
blah blah halfway through it. Will give it credit for entertainment,
Star Power and music score. Went as a family on school night so family
really enjoyed it. I missed having a relevant plot but my standards
probably to high. Was hoping this would become the new James Bond-like
flicks but...Definitely expect more sequels so stand-by, sigh...

The first Kingsman was subtle with Obama's head exploding. This here is
just pandering and irritating. 2016 and 2017 are the years Trump gets
bashed a bunch by angry voters and celebrities. At this point, it's
real old and it's not funny anymore. It is so ham fisted in your face
in this film that you just want to die. Basically, Trump is an evil man
who wants to kill all the druggies so that no more drugs will be
distributed. Then, they have Hillary Clinton who is the vice president.
By the end you know it all, Trump's impeached. Hillary becomes the
president of the United States.

What a bad movie, we have here. Everything about this movie sounds false, the cinematography is
completely saturated, which at the beginning of the film, all the
action sequences look like false and consequently all the excitement
and adrenaline goes down the drain. I say sewers. Sorry. After all, the main character at the beginning of
the movie will stop at the sewers to go to see his girlfriend. Yes,
that's where this movie belongs.In other words, an annoying and boring action movie, we have here.
Because of that, the film changes from set piece to set piece, yet the
scenes are poorly structured, the scenes are saturated, with the pace
to be slow as a turtle, which makes the scenes that should be fun to
see, in empty action scenes without any impact, example each punch that
a character gives to another character does not have any impact, so
does not have emotion or excitement.Not only that, as the characters have such exaggerated action scenes,
these action scenes make the action sequences of the superheroes films
tiny in comparison. Remember, they are not beings with superpowers, but
simple humans. The feeling of danger or death ends up completely
disappearing. And in the end, we end up not caring about the fate of
the characters which are in the movie itself. Or better, the characters
who had nothing interesting to connect with the audience since the
beginning of the film. The characters are generics and poorly executed
and written.If an action movie, can not produce good sequences of action, for what
purpose this movie exists, anyway? This movie also does not convince anyone as a spy movie because the
film is not serious enough and as a comedy movie, the elements of
comedy are too bad to laugh, that is, the film still fails because the
movie itself has no definite tone, so, is this a action movie? a comedy
or a traditional spy movie? Apparently nobody knows, not even the
filmmakers themselves.Not to mention, the acting sucks too. Halle berry, should have stopped
acting since the last 10 years. Julianne Moore, why are you here? You
also do not convince anyone in an action movie. Stay in your dramas. I
do not remember, the acting of the other actors. This movie so passable
and generic. A film to avoid totally, to speak the truth.



I watched this movie with my cinema-employed friend having not seen the
previous ep made before this one. It didn't matter as some of it was
explained as the picture went on and much of the action set pieces were
entertaining enough for me to not care too much if I occasionally got
confused. Oh, and there's a famous Music Star who appears throughout
much of it to make it even more enjoyable especially as I know it's my
friend's favorite singer. So that's my recommendation of Kingsman: The
Golden Circle.

I went to see this with friends and my girl. We all agreed that it was
cool. Loads of funny rofl moments and kick-ass action packed scenes.
Mainly a story about honorable iconic agents working f*** hard to fight
for justice and defend/protect citizens during dark terror situations.
Heroism without all the cool mutant powers of some other movies, lol.

These movies are fun and entertaining, and a nice tongue in cheek ode
to James Bond - films that are by no means less absurd. The villains
are hilariously ridiculous to the point of over- saturation. They're
crazy on the verge of cartoon crazy and Poppy was particularly over the
top. Yet it kinda worked since these films don't take themselves
seriously. Taron as Eggsy is always charismatic and great at the action
scenes. I've seen him in several other films/TV and I really hope he
continues to do well. I really liked the first movie. It wasn't perfect, but it was good.
There was humor, charm, and that fight scene with Colin Firth is
probably one of the best in film ever. With that said, this second
movie was a disaster. The film makers tried too hard to recreate things
from the first movie instead of letting the second stand on its own. At
the end of the day this movie was basically a dramatization about the
legalization of drugs using spies. (Side note: The movie definitely
made a statement about U.S. politics that was appropriate given the
current climate, but nonetheless depressing.) The main issues I had are below. 1) The plot of the movie starts when Charlie gets the Kingsmen
information and gives it to Poppy, but the reasoning is never
explained. We know he hates them, but she wouldn't have even known
about them unless he had told her. She's an American and they're a very
secret British government agency. So why did she take on his vendetta
so viciously? 2) There is no mention of the events in the first movie. They could
have closed it up with a short conversation and moved on. Yet there is
nothing about how everyone was going around killing each other or how
tons of politicians and celebrities abruptly died.3) We're introduced to a new agency in America, but then learn
virtually nothing about them. We know they make alcohol and have very
stereotypically American toys that are not as concealable as their
British counterparts, but we only ever see one member long enough to
characterize them. He ends up being a bad guy and dies. Anyone else we
see has no personality, and I'm pretty sure they only got the A-list
actors so they could put them on the poster. Why was Channing Tatum
even in this? He was frozen the whole time. (I can't stand him, but
that's unrelated.) 4) I love Colin Firth as Harry so I understand why they brought him
back, but mostly it was pointless. They killed him off in the first
movie because it was unexpected. That movie kept stating how it's "not
that kind of movie", yet clearly now it was, because his death wasn't
final. Now anyone can come back from the dead, which means no one's
death means anything. They didn't even do anything interesting with his
character! The amnesia thing really didn't work for me and it felt like
a cop out.5) They took Roxy and Merlin and I was really mad. Roxy didn't even get
a chance to be an agent! She got killed right at the beginning of the
film! I was so close to yelling obscenities in the theater. I had been
looking forward to how her character developed. However, given that
Harry came back, maybe these two will show up alive in the next movie
in some far-fetched way. 6) They never explained how Harry knew that Whiskey was working against
them. He just said he knew, shot him, and then they left it. And I
don't care how great your technology is - no one comes back from a
bullet wound to the head that quickly. 7) Did we need to have the fingering scene at the music festival? No. I
think they were trying to one-up the butt sex scene from the first
movie, but even that joke was in poor taste. I think the scene's real
purpose was so they could set up a plausible reason for Taron to have
his one obligatory shirtless scene. (That part I didn't mind because
daaaaaamn he's fit.)8) The first Elton John joke was funny, and maybe the second. Any joke
after that was more than was necessary. They overdid it on Elton.9) A royal wedding. Seriously? A royal wedding? That was just stupid.
Why did they even have him dating the princess? The film didn't need a
love story. It needed a better writer.Overall, not impressed. All I can say is if they make a third
installment they better get Tom Hiddleston to be a Kingsmen agent to
make up for this terrible sequel.

Although this review might not 'seem' to relate to the film - it is, in
actuality an overall review of several titles that have the same core
values.So, here we are again (apparently)... you know, the Americans saving
the day - or more familiarly, saving the Brits.Yes... the Americans won the 1st and 2nd World Wars - of course, the US
didn't enter the first world war until 1917 (it started in 1914, by the
way - and, up until their 'rescue' they'd been selling arms to both
sides of the conflict with huge financial gain)That aside, they 'rescued' the Brits again during the 2nd World War,
which started in 1939 but didn't see a US face until late 1941. Once again, before entering the conflict, the US had been selling arms
(to multiple sides this time) - hey... 'It's all about the money..
money..' (i think that's how the song goes).But.. we should, by now, have gotten used Americas re-writing of
History - I mean, didn't they manage to capture the 'Enigma Machine' -
responsible for the saving of countless lives? It must be true - I saw
Matthew McConaughey and Bill Paxton in it!But all of the above baffles me... because truly, the US really does
have many, many good things to take credit for - so, why steal it?Anyway, the above was not meant as an aside - it's relevant to the
review - because it underlies the basic facets of this movie - where
the Brits are made to look both incompetent and dimwitted by our US
brethren (that implies a brotherhood that at least one of us no longer
feels.).



I only went to this movie because my kids were excited to see it. Wow,
just too dumb for words. And so retro, and not in a good way. Every
female character either sits behind a computer or is there for window
dressing. And such a waste of the monumental talents of Julianne Moore.
It very much has the feel of the Bond movies of the past, and I don't
mean that as a compliment: the men race around, magically dodging
bullets, while the women wear sexy clothing and make goo-goo eyes at
the big strong men. WTH? I have to rewatch Wonder Woman just to get the
bad taste out of my mouth. And the laws of physics do not apply to this
universe, wherever it is. I know it's escapism, but it's the worst
possible kind. I really thought that we had entered a new era of action
movies, with a more nuanced take on plots, character development, and
relationships. This movie is a dinosaur. Bleh. I gave the movie 2 stars
- one for the weird but delightful presence of Elton John (and great
use of his music), and one for the weird anti anti-drug message and the
mocking of a foolish, small-minded president.



This movie was AWFUL and a complete waste of $30! Such a
disappointment! I feel let down by the IMDb rating; I feel duped as
movies of this caliber are usually rated around a 4-5 star...not 7
star. Do yourselves a favour and don't pay to see this movie. Stream
for free if you're really interested and I guarantee you won't last
more than 10 mins. Or wait until you can rent it for $4 but even then
I'd see that as a complete waste of snack money.Honestly one of the
worst movies I've seen in recent history, alongside Zoolander 2 and Eye
In The Sky.

I'm not gonna comment much on the quality of this movie, everything has
been pretty much been said. It's lazy, unfunny etc.. What I want to
comment on is product placement. This movie was clearly paid by Alcohol
trade to not only focus on their product, but to also take a jab on the
marijuana industry. This was evident when they put marijuana in the
same category with Heroin and Cocaine, while marijuana has become
legalized, just like alcohol. They go so far as to have everyone who
smokes marijuana get infected only to have Hale Berry in close up say
"thats why you should drink whiskey".. Cheap
